Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This image serves as a complete data transport system. It include the
base AlmaLinux OS image, Python interpreter, data transport package and
the INN news server. When running, external volumes can be mounted to
persist the system state between runs. The container can preload the
transport application into the image at the build stage or it can be
used for application development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your transport application code goes into the transport/groups directory.
Any Python dependencies should be added to the pyproject.toml file and the
uv.lock file updated. When the container image is created, the transport
directory will be copied into the image and the dependencies installed.

The makefile can be used for building the image. There are also commands
for starting a container based on the image, as well as stopping it and
accessing a shell.

The work flow would look like this:

    - Update the transport code in transport/groups
    - Add dependencies to pyproject.toml
        
        uv add <package>

    - If needed, the lock can be updated with

        uv lock

    - Remove older versions of the container image

        make clean

    - Build new container image

        make build

    - Start an instance of the container

        make start

    - Access a shell

        make shell

        (run "exit" to leave)

        Use make root-shell to run a shell as root

    - To view the transport log files

        make viewlog

    - Stop the container instance

        make stop

    - To see all make commands:

        make help

The name of the image and container are listed in the makefile and can
be supplied on the command line if needed. For example, running:

    make build NAME=datatransport-myapp TAG=3.0

would result in an image named datatransport-myapp:3.0 and a container
started as datatransport-myapp.
