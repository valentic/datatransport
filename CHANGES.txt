	  config files. The use of name is now deprecated and
	  will eventually be removed.

	- NewsgroupMonitor - add feedgroups, which work similar
	  to the plotgroups in PlotTool.

	- Release 2.0.85

2010-03-02	Todd Valentic

	  stack to be before the variable defaults.

	- PlotTool - do not draw line when stacking plots

	- Release 2.0.84

2010-01-25	Todd Valentic

	- Major reworking of the way processes are terminated. Now
	  stop groups one by one, waiting until all processes are
	  stopped before moving on. This wait ensures that the
	  priority scheme works as exepcted. Before, the programs
	  were all stopped in priority order, but we did not wait
	  for completion, so a higher priority process might have
	  exited before a lower priority one that depended on it.

	- Running stop(), stopclient() and stopgroup() will block
	  whereas they didn't before.

	- ProcessClient no longer calls logout() in the signal
	  handler (it can't because the signal is often sent in
	  the stop call that is blocking).

	- Added small delay in init script restart. We now cleanly
	  can restart - something that has been broken for awhile.

	- Release 2.0.83

	- Add getFileTime() to ArchiveGroups to support timestamps in output
	  filenames based on a time relevant to the file instead of the message.
	  The use case is situations where we have multiple files attached that
	  each have their own timestamp. Previously, we only did things based on
	  the message timestamp. We probably need to rethink the entire archive
	  organization to better reflect multiple files (the accounting sort of
	  assumes on file per message).

2008-11-10	Todd Valentic

	  - Release 2.0.56

2008-08-12	Todd Valentic

        overridden in an inherited class to provide for
        different methods of saving files (i.e. writing
        to an HDF5 file format).

    - Remove timestamp from subject line in news postings

    - Extra headers were not being applied in postText

    - Catch exceptions in XMLRPCServerMixin

2006-07-07  Todd Valentic

    - Add automatic dependency ordering to DirectoryMixin
        connect() method.

2006-06-14  Todd Valentic

    - Use directory service to look up label description
      for the ident() method in XMLRPCServerMixin.

2006-06-01  Todd Valentic

    - Added bin/tc and bin/console programs

2006-05-31  Todd Valentic

    - Added newsserver.port option to NewsPollMixin config.

2006-05-09  Todd Valentic

    - Added XMLRPCServerMixin and DirectoryServices

2006-04-20  Todd Valentic

    - Modify Makefile.am to create var and log files, plus set
      the mode of groups to include g+s and g+w

2006-02-09  Todd Valentic

    - Added AccessMixin

2006-02-07  Todd Valentic

    - Make sure that NewsTool.messageDate always returns a datetime
      object with a timezone. Default to UTC if it doesn't have one.

2006-02-03  Todd Valentic
    - Moved log files and working directories out of the group.home
      space and into $TOP/log and $TOP/var. This is to keep the files that
      are generated locally at run time separate from the group
      configuration. That way when you want to work on a group and
      back it up or install it, you just need to group the config
      directory and don't have to manually clean out the files.

    - Moved the server config (transportd.conf) into $TOP/etc

    - Added support/migratedirs to help in migrating existing sites.

2006-02-02  Todd Valentic
    - PlotTool now creates output path if needed

2006-01-18  Todd Valentic
    - Code cleanup in Components/GroupControl
    - Added exit() method to ProcessClient

2005-12-21  Todd Valentic
    - Catch up messages in NewsPoller if the lastid is less then
      the first available message.
    - Fixed bug in NewsPoller in the case the server was not ready.

2005-11-30  Todd Valentic
    - Show configuration files in ProcessGroup and Client debug logs.

2005-11-12  Todd Valentic
    - Pass through keywords for get() methods in ProcessClient.

2005-11-08  Todd Valentic
    - Modified viewlog to only sort on timestamps. This should
      keep the lines in order (except for lines without times).

    - Modified TransportServer to only return groups with clients
      in the listgroups() method. This change will filter out the
      directories that only have groups in them.

    - Fixed install scripts for ServerMonitor cgi-bin images.

2005-10-16  Todd Valentic
    - Fixed bug in ArchiveGroups for time span/maxMessages.

2005-09-20  Todd Valentic
	- Added small extra delay in ProcessClient.wait() to make
	  sure that we really are at the expected time.

2005-08-12  Todd Valentic
    - Modified ArchiveGroups to use maxMessages in time spans.

2005-07-29  Todd Valentic
    - Modify NewsPollMixin to support wild cards in group names
    - Cleanup listGroups() in NewsTool

2005-06-22  Todd Valentic
    - Modified default PATH to be /usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin
    - Fixed log display for ServerMonitor

2005-06-15  Todd Valentic

    - Extended Util.PatternTemplate to handle dictionaries
    - Fixed bug in NewsPoller (processPast)
    - Added headers to pattern templates in ArchiveGroups
    - Added options() to ConfigComponent

2005-05-11  Todd Valentic

    - Added the SyncPoller component
    - Modified methods in NewsTool and NewsPollMixin to
      support the ability to extract messages (used by SyncPoller)
    - Added ability to set news server port in NewsTool

2005-04-19  Todd Valentic

    - Added Scheduler component

2005-04-17  Todd Valentic

    - Added put() to ProcessClient so clients can add
      parameters to their configuration space.
    - Added corresponding put() method to ConfigComponent.

2005-04-10  Todd Valentic

    - Added isRunning and isStopped methods to ProcessClient

2005-04-07  Todd Valentic

    - Added 'DD days, HH:MM:SS' for getDeltaTime formats.
    - Added parse_deltatime method in Util.datefunc.

2004-07-26  Todd Valentic

    - Cleared environment in runprocess to match the one seen
      when actually running as a transport process.

    - Use configured username instead of default 'transport' in
      runprocess

    - Set HOME in TransportServer to be path.base

2004-07-15  Todd Valentic

    - Added new TimePlot component - uses postgresql and numarray
    - Added TimeBins to Util (used in TimePlot)

2004-04-04  Todd Valentic

    - Removed code to figure out the hostname in configure.in and
      just use the ac_hostname variable which is already defined.

2004-02-26  Todd Valentic

    - Modified NewsTool.py's saveFiles
      method to handle non-multipart
      messages.

2004-02-10  Todd Valentic

    - Added new ServerMonitor web interface.
      Still needs to be cleaned up, don't
      know if I like the tabs, but much
      better then before!

    - New ResourceMonitor component for
      watching server resources like memory,
      load and disk usage.

    - Added ResourceMonitor client to the
      ServerMonitor process group.

    - Added check in PostDataFiles to avoid
      compressing file if already compressed.

    - Added max file size check to PostDataFiles.

2004-02-08  Todd Valentic

    - Use DeltaTime in ServerMonitor programs
      rotatelogs.py and watchdog.py

    - Cleaned up unused imports in TransportClient
      and ProcessClient

2004-02-01  Todd Valentic

    - Added the ConfigComponent module and
      the getComponents to ConfigMixin to
      support generalized loading of
      components in config files.

    - Added texttable.py package to Utils

    - Added DiskMonitor.py

2003-08-28  Todd Valentic

    - Changed install script to not recursively
      set the ownership of the group directory.
      Some groups (usually for CGI scripts) set
      certain directories to other users and
      these were being reset during install.

    - Added "autostart" option to ./configure
      to allow for setting of the initial
      autostart value in the transportd.conf
      file. This is useful for the test setups.

2003-08-24  Todd Valentic

    - Improved image name selection in WatchURL
      by adding an exclude list and picking up
      names in anchor tags.

    - Changed PlotTool to use the newer pyrrdtool.

2003-08-21  Todd Valentic

    - Fixed bug in ArchiveGroups - when files were
      opened for saving, they weren't closed before
      the callback function was called.

    - Fixed bug in NewsTool - wasn't handling news
      groups list properly in processPast.

    - ArchiveGroups now takes a DeltaTime object
      for pollrate.

    - ArchiveGroups now has option to not overwrite
      output file if it already exists.

2003-08-14  Todd Valentic

    - Created ConfigMixin to hold high level get*
      methods for config files. These are often
      used in non-ProcessClient derived classes.

2003-08-11  Todd Valentic

    - Refined PlotTool
    - Added multiple newgroup polling to NewsPollMixin

2003-07-22  Todd Valentic

    - Added PlotTool class and plottool component

2003-07-01  Todd Valentic

    - Cleaned up ArchiveGroups
    - Made the default umask a config paramter
    - Changed the default umask to 0002 from 0
      which caused the directories to be created
      rwx for all.

2003-06-29  Todd Valentic

    - Fix tools/Makefile.am to install rebuilddatabase
    - Updates to ProcessClient and NewsTool
    - Major change to NewsTool.NewsPoller - simplified
      the callback interface to be only one function.
      Removed the three processXXXX versions. This has
      the unfortunate consquence that most polling
      clients need to be updated!
    - Updated files in doc (examples,python10) to new
      NewsPoller interface
    - Split components/RealTimeFeed into wrapper and
      object like all the other components

2003-06-20  Todd Valentic

    - Added createDeltaTime to ProcessClient
    - ProcessClient.wait() can now accept DeltaDateTime.
    - Added callbacks to determine date in PostDataFiles.

2003-06-11  Todd Valentic

    - Added generic callback mechanism to ProcessClient.
    - Added callback to ArchiveGroups.
    - Converted InstrumentStatus callback to new scheme.
    - Fixed compression detect bug in ArchiveGroups.
    - Use email module for unpacking messages.
    - Fixed a bug in realtimefeed which prevented relaying.

2003-05-15  Todd Valentic

    - Added timezone.py to Transport.Util

2003-05-11  Todd Valentic

    - Added callback plugins to InstrumentStatus. You
      now write an external function and have it called
      each time the instrument status is checked.

2003-04-30  Todd Valentic

    - Renamed init.d config scripts in support directory
      to the actual names (transpotrd.init -> transportd
      and omniORB.init -> omniORB).

    - transportd was not being installed. fixed.

    - omniORB init script now configured with omniORB
      path if specified.

    - added check for innd path in configure.

2003-04-15  Todd Valentic

    - Major cleanup of NewsTool.

    - Removed a bunch of old, unused code:

        - Util.hostname

    - Added X-Transport-Date header to messages that specify
      a date to NewsPoster posting methods.

2003-02-15  Todd Valentic

    - Added transportps to make it easy to list the running
      transport processes.

    - Improved catchup behaviour of NewsPoller. You can now
      request the last few articels to start off instead of
      just marking everything as read.

2003-02-06  Todd Valentic

    - Added a return value to wait() in ProcessClient. The
      return is 0 or 1 indicating if the client is still
      running. We can now write the main loop like:

      while self.wait(rate):
         ... do something ...

      This construct assumes we want the wait to happen first.
      Otherwise we would use a do..repeat like structure:

      while self.running:
        ...
        if not self.wait(rate):
            break

2002-12-18  Todd Valentic

    - Added a signal handler in TransportServer to ignore
      SIGCHLD signals. This prevents zombie (defunct)
      processes from hanging around after a program in a
      process group has been stopped. This became a problem
      after the change to spawnev() instead of system() for
      starting child programs.

    - Fixed filewatch to handle failed connections to the
      news server during posting. It had been dying when
      the load level was high and the news server throttled.
      The other components should be examined for similar
      failures.

    - Changed the config file options for filewatch to be
      more consistent (watch.*)

2002-08-28  Todd Valentic

    - Modified build/install system to use GNU autoconf.
      Also added the ability to do parallel installs so
      different versions could be run along side each
      other.

    - Changed sri.transport -> Transport (necessary for
      the parallel install concept). The true path is
      bootstrapped in the paths.py file.

    - The Transport package is now local to the install
      directory instead of the system's python path.

    - Dropped the .py ending for the base components to
      make them appear more as standalone programs:

        archivegroups.py -> archivegroups.
        filestore.py -> filestore
        filewatch.py -> filewatch
        groupcontrol.py -> groupcontrol
        postdatafiles.py -> postdatafiles
        realtimefeed.py -> realtimefeed.py

    - Reorganized directory layout of package.

    - Made a default, stripped down  ServerMonitor group.
      Removed maillist, link tests and group control.
      The instrument monitoring will go into a separate group.

    - Removed web user functions from transportclt.

    - With the transition to python2 we don't need to have a
      local ConfigParser to fix the old bugs. Now use the
      standard library version.

    - Updated all the group files to match the new scheme.
      Expect some problems during the transition, so watch
      the logs closely.

    - Removed the ServerMonitor from most groups since it
      is part of the default install. The piece missing
      was the old SystemMonitor, which has now been replaced
      with InstrumentMonitor.

    - Bug fixes to ArchiveGroups.



2002-03-22  Todd Valentic

    - Changed the internals of NewsPollMixin. It now adds
      a method to the class: createNewsPoller() that can
      be used as a factory to create NewsPoller objects.

2002-03-04  Todd Valentic

    - Added group.dirname to the base config file. This param
      compliments the group.basename and is useful in deeply
      layered process groups.

    - Reorganized code in anticipation of trying to use distutils
      for installation and distribution. This experiment will
      be ongoing, so for now the old install.py script remains
      the primary means of installing the files.

2002-01-24  Todd Valentic

    - Major cleanup of the NewsPollMixin and NewsPostMixin.
      The change having the largest impact deals with the
      renaming of a number of configuration parameters. Until
      now, the parameters were a combination of styles. They
      are now grouped under poll.* and post.* (and the prefix
      can be user setable).

    - Moved the groups directory entirely out of the core
      transport distribution. I'll probably add back in a
      minimal server monitor group once that has been rewritten
      to be less site-specific.

    - Renamed the NewsTool.NewsPoller processFunc() to be
      processFiles() to reflect that it deals with file
      attachments.

2002-01-23  Todd Valentic

    - Basic signal handling has been added to ProcessClient.
      We catch TERM,INT,HUP to nicely shutdown client programs.
      The same idiom was showing up in a number of clients, so
      it makes more sense to move this behaviour up to the base
      class.

    - Added a traceback printing method for dumping errors to the
      log. This routine will not only help in interpreting bugs
      but lessen the need to have special "debug" code paths.

    - Fixed some things in ArchiveGroups. The call to makedirs
      needed to check if the path first existed and the signal
      handling routines were removed since ProcessClient now
      provides them.

2002-01-22  Todd Valentic

    - Found long-standing problem with supplemental groups.
      The daemon option of transportd was not setting the
      groups, they were being inherited by what ever user
      was initially setting up the environment. We should
      be using os.setgroups() to get the supplemental group
      list, but this call is not available in python < 2.2.
      The work around is to use the rc.transportd setup
      script to start transportd as the transport user.
      Once we require python 2.2, I'll go back to the older
      method and properly call setgroup().

    - Changed the way ArchiveGroups creates its output files.
      You used to be able to give specifiy the group. Now,
      I use the user private groups and sgid bit to control
      access to the files and have removed excess code.

2002-01-14  Todd Valentic

    - Added summary report to ArchiveGroups.

    - Consolidated the external python libraries (sri-*,pytav)
      into single sri-base plus extensions for the different
      data types (muscox,cedar,medac).

    - Fixed bug in addgroup (NewsTools -> NewsTool).

2001-12-10  Todd Valentic

    - Changed the installgroup script to take a second argument
      designating the destination directory prefix. You can now
      install from a "versioned" directory like "cu-1.0.4" into
      the base group "cu". This script is still just a quick hack
      and needs to be fleshed out for the future.

    - Moved the cedar and muscox python packages out of this
      package and into their own since they are not really
      transport related and specific to the Sondrestrom radar
      processing.

    - Improved signal handling and exit when ProcessClient.abort()
      is called. Made self.running a data member of ProcessClient.

    - Added uncompress ability to ArchiveGroups for automatically
      decompress files when they are written to the archive.

2001-12-03  Todd Valentic

    - Fixed a bug in ArchiveGroups that keeps it from saving multipart
      messages (introduced on 11-28 with change for text bodies). The
      real change was to fix mimetool.py in sri/transport to handle
      the saving of text messages.

2001-12-02  Todd Valentic

    - Changed the start/stop level of the transportd init.d script.
      In the newer versions of redhat, it was being started before
      innd, causing the process groups no end of grief. We now start
      at 99, right at the end.

2001-11-28  Todd Valentic

    - Added date field to subject line in postText() method of NewsTool.
    - Fixed NewsTool import in addgroup, rmgroup and cancelgroup scripts.
    - Fixed ArchiveGroups.py to handle plain text (non-MIME) messages.

2001-11-13  Todd Valentic

    - Added debug mode to FitScan

    - Moved sri.news python functions to sri.transport (we now
      only have one spot for files).

2001-10-23  Todd Valentic

    - Rewrote ArchiveGroups to act as a general storage tool and
      consolidate a number of scripts that all did similar things.

    - Fixed bug in transportctl when chaning parameters for a user
      with the "user set" methods. The parameters were being reset
      to the default values each time.

    - Added the notion of user roles to PageKit and the user database.

2001-08-31  Todd Valentic

    - Changed the way client programs are searched for when started
      by ProcessGroup. Previously, the group appended the group's
      home directory and anything defined by environ.path in the
      config file to os.environ['PATH']. The problem is that each
      ProcessGroup object still lives in the single TransportServer
      process and they all ended up modifying the *same* PATH. When
      you printed it out, it just kept getting longer and longer. It
      also meant that groups would pick up executables from other
      groups (often leading to problems if two groups had a similarly
      named executable). The new method just declares a list of paths
      to search and the executable is explicitly searched for. The
      default path is /usr/bin, /bin, the group's home and then transport
      server's bin (/home/transport/bin). Anything specified by the
      environ.path config file entry is inserted after /bin and before
      the group bin.

2001-08-29  Todd Valentic

    - Major changes to the way groups are installed. Groups can now
      live in a heirarchy (arbitrarily deep). Each directory along
      the path to the group can have it's own config file. Doing so
      let's us finally move items out of the global config that are
      really site specific.

    - Changed the IDL spec to allow for a list of config files instead
      of the global/local/host model used before.

    - When you use transportctl with groups, you need to give the full
      path for the group (ie ProcessDefault -> sri/ProcessDefault).

    - I gutted the complicated install.py routines used by each group.
      Now the top level install script simply copies the entire groups
      directory up to /home/transport. Just create the layout that you
      want locally and that is what will show up in the final install.

    - The group directory changed from /home/transport/group to
      /home/transport/groups. All of the tools were fixed to handle
      this change.

    - The web cgi scripts were modified to handle the changes.

    - The ProcessGroup.py file was modified to include setting the
      PATH environment variable prior to spawing process client commands
      (so it can tell where they are).

    - ProcessGroup.py and TransportServer.py were modified to handle
      the new changes.

    - The Installer.py script is depricated and will go away shortly.

    - The naming of the config files used to be set in the global
      config file. This has changed to a fixed format of <group>.conf
      as was done in practice.

2001-08-11  Todd Valentic

    - Created summit/WeatherStation procress group to gather weather
      and webcam images at the Greenland Summit Camp.

    - Started to fixup filestore.py so that it better catches errors
      during failures. Right now most of the os.system() call returns
      are left unchecked and problems can silently slip by.

    - Seems to be an odd problem that groups can see scripts in other
      groups. I'm not sure how this is possible, but filestore is
      accessible by non-FileStore client programs (this is actually
      a desirable behavior and one I want to add, but in a controlled
      manner!)

2001-08-08  Todd Valentic

    - Removed extra call to create groups in TransportServer.py. This
      was outside of the try...except block and was responsible for
      causing the server to crash on startup with a bad group was
      encountered. This extra call was there from an earlier debugging
      session and never removed. Opps.

    - Updated the INSTALL file to reflect the changes needed for the
      latest version of inn (2.3). A number of configuration files
      are different and some extra steps are needed to get things
      running. The changes are definitely for the better and allow
      for finer control of who can post.

2001-08-07  Todd Valentic

    - Fixed a syntax errors in FileStore/filestore.py (NULL -> None).
      I think I had started upgrading this file and then stopped.
      Need to look closer to make sure it really still works.

    - Updated ArchiveISR/archivegroups.py to have better error checking
      and try to use library functions for directory creation instead
      of shelling out with os.system() all the time. This let's us have
      a better indication of when things fail and why.

2001-02-19  Todd Valentic

    - Renamed LinkBandwidth -> LinkThroughput in ServerMonitor.
        This better reflects what is actually being estimated (the
        time it takes to ftp a set-size file). I also incorporated
        the BandwidthComputer object funcations directly and removed
        the bandwidth.py file from the python/transport section.
        (I also removed a duplicate in the tav python library).
        This change also required updating the ServerMonitor.conf
        file. LinkThroughput utilizes the timeoutsocket.py file, so
        be sure to include it in the python path. I put it in
        /usr/lib/python1.5/site-packages.

        You can find the file at: www.timo-tasi.org/python/timeoutsocket.py

2001-02-15  Todd Valentic

    - Continued to add support for South Pole
        o created ServerMonitor.conf-radar-2.spole.gov

    - Fixed long standing problem in omninames rc startup script
        Compound statment lines in bash needd a trailing ;
        This used to work, but broke with RedHat 7.

2001-02-05  Todd Valentic

    - Added support for the South Pole installation:
        o transportd.conf.in
        o PageKit.py

2000-11-16  Todd Valentic

    - Added lidar archiving to ArchiveISR. This is only a temporary
      addition. I'll soon create a separate AchiveLidar group to
      handle the storage and post-processing checks.

    - Changed to group-name pattern matching in archivegroups.py to use
      the fnmatch module instead of regular-expressions. The filename
      matching style is what I was really after in the first place.

2000-10-26  Todd Valentic

    - Added reportStart capability to systemstatus.py. This compliments
      reportStop which had been intended to alert people when an
      instrument had failed. It can now be used to notify people when
      a specific instrument turns on or off.

    - Added matching rules to filestore.py. This allows you to store
      files into different directories for files in a single newsgroup.

    - Added AllskyImager-Web to FileStore.conf-transport for storing
      real-time imager files for web page.

    - Created groups/sri/ArchiveISR and archivegroups.py.

    - Added notify messages to ProcessAllsky group.
    - Retooled notify.py to accept parameters in message files. This means
      that all the notify.start and notify.stop messages were touched.
    - Renamed the following directories in groups:

         groups/processing -> groups/sri
         groups/boulder -> groups/cu

         to better reflect that they are SRI and CU related processing.

    - Moved realtimefeed.py into the base/general/bin so that it can be
      used by other process groups as a general service.

    - Removed groups/base/FileStore/filestore.py's depedance on the
      DateTime module. It now uses the standard time module instead.

    - Changed the format of the output filename written by filestore.py.
      The user now has complete control of the naming convention.

    - Added sondrestrom.allsky to groups in transportd.conf.

    - Fixed bug in transportctl - needed to import TransportModule.

    - Added getartice tool to system/transport. Use this script to extract
      an article from a newsgroup and unpack the files. I use this when
      testing new processing routines and need to see the access posted files.

    - Added the ProcessWorldDayLTCS group to the ISR processing groups
      for the LTCS World Day campaigns (its a three-position, three minute
      dwell mode).

    - Fixed the gicwind.rps file in ProcessWorldDayWindy group. It was
      looking for *.dt1 files (need to always look for *.mrg, even if
      merging isn't being done).

    - Fixed problem with transportctl's "reload server" command (was
      failing because of an extra parameter. See transportctl for details).

    - ProcessCME was sending data to the oersted newsgroups. Not a
      problem, just caused the notification messages to appear that
      they were coming from an Oersted run. Fixed the .conf file to
      use *.cme.* groups.

    - Fixed ServerMonitor config files for specific sites. I had
      forgotten to add the maillist group, so the default was being
      used instead.

    - Fixed some small problems with transportctl. It would bomb out
      it you didn't include all the necessary command line parameters
      for some options.

    - Fixed bug in system/web/cgi-bin/ViewTransportServer.py that kept
      the log from being printed out.

    - Fixed bug in system/web/cgi-bin/PreferencesForm.py that kept the
      panel from showing up if no maillist groups were available.

    - The install script was not correctly patching the PATHCGI setting
      in transportd.conf.

2000-07-20  Todd Valentic

    - Added command line options for the install.py script.

2000-07-14  Todd Valentic

    - Added the webcam poster to Boulder's CatchAddress processing group.

    - Added the ProcessCME-CJH group for Sondrestrom ISR processing of
      CME events based on Craig Heinselman's new mode.

    - Fixed problem with umimmak's config file for RealTimeFeed (the dt0
      newgroup poll/post were reversed).

2000-07-01  Todd Valentic

    - Updated the path in system/omniorb/omninames to point to the
      latest omniORB bin (i586_linux_2.0_glibc2.1). This is for a
      RedHat 6.x system.

    - Made some changes to the INSTALL notes.

    - Added platteville, boulder and default to the transportd.conf file.

    - Added platteville and boulder to site names in PageKit.py (only
      a temporary kludge for now!)

    - PageKit.py was not accessable to the cgi scripts. Moved back into
      the cgi directory instead of sri.transport.

    - Added platteville config files to base groups.

    - The LinkBandwidth and LinkPlot programs in ServerMonitor should
      not be started in a default configuration (the currently are).
      Need to add some method of controlling which process group programs
      are automatically started.

    - Added webdir to install.conf.

    - Patched web/html/startpage.shtml to point to webdir.

    - Make ServerMonitor/systemstatus.py and serverstatus.py wait before
      making tables so that the transport server can come up fully. The
      initial tables were reporting problems that weren't really true.

    - Reorganized the code directories. All of the processing groups now
      live under "groups" and are split into the base components and the
      SRI processing groups. The python scripts have moved into the python
      directory. The system components, including the web interface, now
      live in system.

    - All of the components now use a python-based installer to install
      their files. This approach allows for a common configuration file
      to be used and hopefully everything should be retargetable to a
      directory of your choice. There are still somethings that aren't
      in there yet like the location of apache and ominORB.

    - The configuration files for process groups were changed slightly.
      There is now a host-specific configuration file that gets loaded
      last (after the global transportd.conf and then the process group
      config file). This allows most of the defaults for process group
      to be combined into a single file and the specifics for different
      sites to remain in the host config file. I'm still completely
      happy with this approach because it means the standard distribution
      is still littered with SRI-specific config files. I'm justifying
      it right now by saying those specific files serve as examples
      (and the only documentation of real-world use!)

    - Started development website at transport.sri.com.

    - Updated the spasms binaries to the latest release from Carol. The
      only change that should impact us is the new acportgm program. New
      fields were added to satisfy the request from the SuperDarn folks.
      The new fields shouldn't impact anyone properly accessing the CEDAR
      file.

    - Changed the CORBA ORB from Fnorb to omniORB. This for a couple of
      reasones:

        o omniORB is a much more complete ORB (full POA, more services, etc)
        o omniORB has C++ bindings in addition to Python
        o omniORB is high performance
        o Fnorb was leaking memory
        o omniORB is actively developed; Fnorb seems to be dying away
        o omniORB is GPL; Fnorb is proprietary
        o omniORB is fully threaded; Fnorb had thread problems

      The changes were minimal, and more pertained to the change from
      using the BOA to the POA. Still need to do some stress testing,
      especially since we are going threaded (I had kicked Fnorb back
      into reactive mode).

    - Added ProcessIris to accomodate the IRIS imager/magnetometer/riometer
      instrument. This also led to a cleanup of the data center posting
      code.
